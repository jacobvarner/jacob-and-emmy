                <h2 id="our-story-heading">Our Story</h2>
                <p class="our-story-text">It all started with the Sadie Hawkins Dance. After years of being mutual friends, Emmy officially made the first move by
                asking me to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/VA5qlVESp5/" target="_blank">Sadie Hawkins dance at the very beginning of 2013</a>. I expected to have a fun time, but mostly because
                we were all going as a friend group. Instead, Emmy ended up making the night even more fun, all by herself. So much fun,
                that I then decided to ask her on a real date for Valentine’s Day 2013. It was on that date with Ragtime Cafe and Starbucks
                that I also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/VvUT2WkSnC/" target="_blank">asked Emmy to my Senior Prom</a>.</p>
                <p class="our-story-text">We attended both <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/XxzxJ9kSsm" target="_blank">my Senior Prom</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/YYZBnUkSht" target="_blank">Emmy’s Junior Prom</a> in 2013 and then one final
                dance at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/mbWgYCkStH" target="_blank">Emmy’s Senior Prom</a> in 2014. High school dances were also accompanied with dinner dates, baking, and other memorable
                high school moments.</p>
                <p class="our-story-text">My freshman year of college, while Emmy was still at Spain Park, taught us to really enjoy the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/fav1TikSqL" target="_blank">moments
                we had together</a> when we got them and taught both of us what being “best friends” was really about. Once Emmy joined me at
                Auburn, we managed to find time between both of our busy schedules for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/sVpWq7ESmj" target="_blank">football game days</a>, the occasional <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBv2o7fJoANOQAi7h5osux8c5nKXE5K79jMz7s0" target="_blank">basketball
                game together</a>, and tons of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-6SUbgkSiB" target="_blank">other great times</a>.</p>
                <p class="our-story-text">College brought it’s challenges with it, and gave both of us a glimpse of what
                a busy life together would possibly be like. But through it all, I very quickly learned that there was no one else I’d rather
                accompany me through the crazy, busy thing that is my life.</p>
                <p class="our-story-text">On July 7th, 2017 I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWSfloJDxff" target="_blank">pulled out all the stops</a> to make sure I truly
                surprised Emmy in asking her to be my wife. As an engaged couple, we’ve had even more opportunities to grow closer together
                and closer to God. After 5 years of dating, our long awaited wedding day is quickly approaching and I truly can’t wait to
                see what God has in store for the future of our fun filled relationship.</p>
